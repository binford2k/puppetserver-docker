This project hosts the Dockerfile and the required scripts to build a Puppet Server container image.

You can run a copy of Puppet Server with the following Docker command:

```bash
docker run --name puppet --hostname puppet ghcr.io/voxpupuli/puppetserver:8.6.1-latest
```

Although it is not strictly necessary to name the container `puppet`, this is
useful when working with the other Puppet images, as they will look for a server
on that hostname by default.

If you would like to start the Puppet Server with your own Puppet code, you can
mount your own directory at `/etc/puppetlabs/code`:

```shell
 docker run --name puppet --hostname puppet -v ./code:/etc/puppetlabs/code ghcr.io/voxpupuli/puppetserver:8.6.1-latest
```

For compose file see: [CRAFTY](https://github.com/voxpupuli/crafty/tree/main/puppet/oss)

You can find out more about Puppet Server in the [official documentation](https://www.puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/server/about_server.html).

## Note about environment caching

⚠️ The Puppetserver has [the environment caching](https://www.puppet.com/docs/puppet/8/server/admin-api/v1/environment-cache.html) enabled by default.
You should explicitly call the API endpoint to clear the cache when a new environment is deployed.
See the `curl` example below.

```bash
curl -i --cert $(puppet config print hostcert) \
--key $(puppet config print hostprivkey) \
--cacert $(puppet config print cacert) \
-X DELETE \
https://$(puppet config print server):8140/puppet-admin-api/v1/environment-cache?environment=production
```

Another option is to disable the environment caching by setting the `PUPPETSERVER_ENVIRONMENT_TIMEOUT` environment variable to zero (`0`).

## New version schema

The new version schema has the following layout:

```text
<puppet.major>.<puppet.minor>.<puppet.patch>-v<container.major>.<container.minor>.<container.patch>
```

Example usage:

```shell
docker run --name puppet --hostname puppet -v ./code:/etc/puppetlabs/code/ ghcr.io/voxpupuli/puppetserver:8.6.1-v1.6.0
```

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| puppet.major | Describes the contained major Puppet version (7 or 8) |
| puppet.minor | Describes the contained minor Puppet version |
| puppet.patch | Describes the contained patchlevel Puppet version |
| container.major | Describes the major version of the base container (Ubunutu 22.04) or incompatible changes |
| container.minor | Describes new features or refactoring with backward compatibility |
| container.patch | Describes if minor changes or bugfixes have been implemented |

## Initialization Scripts

If you would like to do additional initialization, add a directory called `/docker-custom-entrypoint.d/` and fill it with `.sh` scripts.
These scripts will be executed at the end of the entrypoint script, before the service is ran.

## Persistance

If you plan to use the in-server CA, restarting the container can cause the server's keys and certificates to change, causing agents and the server to stop trusting each other.
To prevent this, you can persist the default cadir, `/etc/puppetlabs/puppetserver/ca`.
For example:

```shell
docker run -v $PWD/ca-ssl:/etc/puppetlabs/puppetserver/ca ghcr.io/voxpupuli/puppetserver:8.6.1-latest
```

or in compose:

```yaml
services:
  puppet:
    image: ghcr.io/voxpupuli/puppetserver:8.6.1-latest
    # ...
    volumes:
      - ./ca-ssl:/etc/puppetlabs/puppetserver/ca
```
